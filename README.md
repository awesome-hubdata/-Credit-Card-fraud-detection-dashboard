# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard

This project is a **Machine Learning-powered Fraud Detection Dashboard** built with **Streamlit** and **XGBoost**.  
It allows users to upload transaction data (CSV format) and detect **potential fraudulent transactions** in real-time.
The model is trained on the popular **credit card fraud dataset** and can predict anomalies using advanced gradient boosting algorithms.
